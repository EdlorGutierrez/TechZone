<header><h2>The World Is Like a Game </h2></header>
<p>In your life, you are the protagonist, you are the one who undergone the storyline, you made the decision, your friends and family are your party, every routines and struggles you do is the gameplay,<br> academic or career achievements as the "achievements", and the rewards are abstract.

You live in an infinite resolution world, with highest FPS ever, no lag or latency, fully multiplayer with other person as the other players, and you decide when to cooperate or compete each other.<br> You can be a bad rep player and many people hates you, or you can be a good rep player and have a lot of people loves you.

The only real different between life and game world is that the game reward is short term, measurable, and you are grateful of it.<br> On the other hand, real world reward is long term, intangible, and sometimes you don't feel grateful of it because you take it for granted.</p>
