<ol>

<p>
<li><b> Shooting Game or FPS Game </b><br> Action video games in the first person shooter (FPS) genre are played from the viewpoint of the main character.<br> FPS games frequently simulate an actual player's motions and give a glimpse of what they would see and do in-game.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><b> Role-playing (RPG) </b><br> These games cover a wide range of titles where the player creates or assumes control of a character and can progress through leveling up by gaining experience points.<br> A unifying theme and a clear tale are two features that RPGs frequently share.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><b> Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) </b><br>To vanquish opponents in a fight is the only objective of the strategy role-playing game genre known as MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena).<br> In contrast to the strategy genre, each MOBA player only has control over one hero and participates in the team's general plan. 
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><b> Real-time strategy (RTS) </b><br> A time-based computer game known as real-time strategy (RTS) is focused on using resources to create units and fight enemies.<br> When compared to turn-based strategy games, where each player has time to carefully contemplate his or her next move without having to worry about the opponent's actions,<br> real-time strategy games are frequently described as being more strategic.<br> Real-time strategy games require players to accumulate resources, protect their bases, and launch attacks while while being aware of the opponent's frantic efforts to accomplish the same tasks.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><b> Puzzlers and party games </b><br> Due to the emphasis on game mechanics in both of these games, there is some major overlap. These games will typically include a theme, a narrative, or be modeled after a classic board game.<br> Party games frequently feature multiplayer and increase gameplay. Games with puzzles are puzzlers. 
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><b> Action-adventure </b><br>Since it is a hybrid genre, action-adventure games often fall into other, more specific categories. Pure adventure games typically include the user solving situational puzzles with little to no action.<br> If there is action, it usually only occurs during individual minigames. The gameplay in pure action games is built on in-the-moment interactions that test the player's reflexes.<br> As a result, both problem-solving and reflexes are used in action-adventure games in both violent and non-violent settings.
