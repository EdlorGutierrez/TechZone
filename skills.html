<p>
<li>You need to put in as much practice as you can. Take occasional rests to rest your eyes, but keep practicing as your main priority.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Understand and master the game's mechanics. To get accustomed to the gameplay, experiment with all of the options.</li>
</p>
<li>Find a playstyle. How would you like to play? Do you intend to be combative? Defensive? Perhaps you want a fighter, a tank, a support, or perhaps two fighters!</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Have a backup playstyle at all times. You want a secondary function like a tank or support if your primary duty is a fighter. Keep in mind that sometimes you can't get what you want, especially in games.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Find out how your opponent plays. Knowing how a team plays and understanding how to play against them is crucial if you ever find yourself competing against them.</li>
